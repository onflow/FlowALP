### Overview
This PR migrates `TidalProtocol` from scaled `UInt128` and `DeFiActionsMathUtils` to native `UFix128` and a new `TidalMath` helper.

### Why
- Native decimals: precision and clarity with Cadence fixed-point UFix128.
- Fewer pitfalls: remove implicit 1e24 scaling and conversion bugs.
- Consistent rounding: centralize UFix64 conversions in `TidalMath`.
- Simpler code: use native * and / for arithmetic.

### What changed
- Contracts
  - Add `cadence/lib/TidalMath.cdc` with constants (one, zero), toUFix128, and UFix64 rounding helpers (toUFix64Round, toUFix64RoundUp, toUFix64RoundDown).
  - Refactor `cadence/contracts/TidalProtocol.cdc`:
    - Use UFix128 for prices, factors, indices, health, and liquidation math.
    - TokenSnapshot fields renamed: creditIndex, debitIndex.
    - RiskParams stores decimal fractions for collateralFactor, borrowFactor, liquidationBonus (e.g., 0.05).
    - Rewrite scaledBalanceToTrueBalance, trueBalanceToScaledBalance, health, max-withdraw, and liquidation to native decimals.
    - Replace TidalMath.mul/div with native * and / for brevity.
    - Remove unused imports; avoid bitwise operations on UFix128.
- Scripts
  - position_health.cdc: return type UFix128.
  - funds_req_for_target_health_after_withdraw.cdc: targetHealth: UFix128.
  - funds_avail_above_target_health_after_deposit.cdc: targetHealth: UFix128.
- Tests
  - `cadence/tests/test_helpers.cdc`: UFix128 constants/helpers; deploy TidalMath before TidalProtocol.
  - Migrate math/liquidation/insolvency/funds and integration tests to UFix128 semantics.
  - Remove DeFiActionsMathUtils imports; use native ops or TidalMath rounding helpers.
  - Align `phase0_pure_math_test.cdc` with new TokenSnapshot and RiskParams fields.
- Config
  - Update `flow.json` to register TidalMath; remove DeFiActionsMathUtils from emulator deployments.

### How it works
- Use UFix128 end-to-end for protocol math.
- Use TidalMath only for conversions/rounding where needed.
- Prefer native * and / for readability and less boilerplate.

### Breaking changes
- Scripts/transactions now accept/return UFix128 for health and ratios.
- RiskParams.liquidationBonus is a fraction (e.g., 0.05), not 1 + LB.
- TokenSnapshot uses creditIndex/debitIndex.

### Validation
- Full Cadence test suite passes on this branch.

### DeFiActions utilities
- DeFiActionsUtils and DeFiActionsMathUtils are no longer required by TidalProtocol; TidalMath supersedes them.

### Follow-ups
- Consider exponentiation-by-squaring if integer exponents reappear in interest compounding.
